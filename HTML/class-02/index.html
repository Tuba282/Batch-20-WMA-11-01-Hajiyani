        even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you
        won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about.

        <dt>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</dt>
        <dd>HTML is the backbone or skeleton of a web page. It is a standard markup language used to structure content
            and give it semantic meaning. HTML consists of elements (like headings, paragraphs, links, and images) that
            tell the browser how to display the content, forming the basic building blocks of any website. </dd>

        <dt>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</dt>
        <dd>CSS is the interior designer or appearance of a web page. It is used to style HTML elements, controlling the
            layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall visual presentation. CSS transforms raw HTML structure into a
            visually attractive and engaging user interface. </dd>

        <dt>JavaScript (JS)</dt>
        <dd>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic functionality to web
            pages, acting like the brain or waitstaff in a restaurant analogy. While HTML and CSS create static
            elements, JavaScript allows for interactive features like form validations, animations, real-time updates,
            and data fetching from servers, bringing the web page to life. </dd>
